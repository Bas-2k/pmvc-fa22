## Guide to running the notebook on Google Colab

1. Sorry, you'll need to create a Google account to use Colab.
2. Download the files in [this repository](https://github.com/raj-magesh/pmvc-fa22) by clicking the green `Code` button followed by `Download ZIP`.
3. Extract the files from the ZIP archive using whatever tool your OS provides.
4. Open a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) instance.
5. Navigate to `File > Open notebook` (or `Ctrl+O`).
6. On the GitHub tab, enter the URL as `raj-magesh/pmvc-fa22` and click the search button.
7. Click on the `homework_1/homework_1.ipynb` link.
8. Click on the `Connect`/`Reconnect` button (top-right, next to `Editing`). This will connect your notebook to a Google server where the code will be run.
9. Click on the small folder icon on the left pane. This should open a panel on the left with a file browser interface.
10. Right-click on the file browser panel, click `New folder`, and create a new directory called `data`.
11. Right-click the `data` directory and click `Upload`, then select all the files under `homework_1/data` that you got in Step 2 after extracting the ZIP archive.
12. You are ready to run the notebook!
