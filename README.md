# AS.050.375/675.FA22 Probabilistic Models of the Visual Cortex

This repository contains [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) code in the form of interactive [Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) that are meant to provide practical demonstrations of theoretical concepts discussed in class. You'll be using this code in your homework assignments!

- If you're new to programming/Python/Jupyter Notebooks, we recommend running the code on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Be sure to copy the data files under `homework_1/data` as well!
- If you'd prefer to run notebooks locally, we provide Conda environment files (`environment.yml`) that you can use to generate reproducible environments by running `conda create -f <path_to_environment.yml>`.

Here's a link to [the notebook for Homework 1](https://github.com/raj-magesh/pmvc-fa22/blob/main/homework_1/homework_1.ipynb)!
