# AS.050.375/675.FA22 Probabilistic Models of the Visual Cortex

This repository contains [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) code in the form of interactive [Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) that are meant to provide practical demonstrations of theoretical concepts discussed in class. You'll be using this code in your homework assignments!

- If you're new to programming/Python/Jupyter Notebooks, we recommend running the code on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- If you'd prefer to run notebooks locally, we provide Conda environment files (`environment.yml`) that you can use to generate reproducible environments by running `conda create -f <path_to_environment.yml>`.

For these homework assigments, most of the code is written for you. The provided utility functions should make it easy for you to solve the assignment: your job will primarily be to evaluate the functions with different parameters and interpret the output. If you have any trouble, start a Canvas discussion, attend office hours, or email us!

## Notebooks

- [Homework 1](https://github.com/raj-magesh/pmvc-fa22/blob/main/homework_1/homework_1.ipynb)!
- [Homework 2 - Edge Detection](https://github.com/raj-magesh/pmvc-fa22/blob/main/homework_2/edge_detection.ipynb)
- [Homework 2 - Sparse Coding](https://github.com/raj-magesh/pmvc-fa22/blob/main/homework_2/sparse_coding.ipynb)

## Working with notebooks

A notebook contains multiple cells. Each is either a Markdown cell (plain-text documentation) or a code cell (Python, can be executed). The Markdown cells contain information that you should read through. The code cells can be run by pressing the run button on the top-left of each cell or by pressing `Ctrl+Enter` when in the cell.
